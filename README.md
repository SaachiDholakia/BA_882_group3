1. What data feed(s) are you considering for your class project?
Answer:
The NNDSS Weekly Data dataset from the CDC is being considered. It provides weekly reports of notifiable diseases across the U.S., tracking infectious diseases and conditions required by law to be reported to public health authorities. This includes diseases like influenza, COVID-19, and other important conditions for public health monitoring.

2. How often do the data get updated (i.e., new records are available and need to be added to your data warehouse)?
Answer:
The dataset is updated weekly. Each week, new records on disease counts and reports are added to the dataset, which will need to be ingested into the data warehouse to keep the analysis current. Weekly updates allow for near real-time tracking of public health trends.

3. Why are you interested in exploring these data feed(s) for your project?
Answer:
The CDC's NNDSS Weekly Data is critical for understanding public health trends and disease outbreaks. By analyzing this data, our project can contribute to monitoring the spread of infectious diseases, identifying patterns over time, and potentially informing healthcare responses. It’s particularly valuable because it provides a national scope and is regularly updated, allowing for timely analysis.
Public health data is also highly relevant today, especially for studying the impacts of seasonal outbreaks (like flu) or pandemics (like COVID-19). Thus, it is a timely and impactful data source for our class project.

4. What are the business problem(s) you will be exploring once your data are being collected?
Answer:
One potential business problem is how to allocate healthcare resources more effectively in response to disease outbreaks. For example, analyzing spikes in reported cases can help predict where more medical supplies, personnel, or vaccinations might be needed.
We can also explore questions related to early detection of disease trends, enabling healthcare providers and policymakers to act quickly to prevent further spread. For instance, the dataset could help address questions about seasonal trends in certain diseases and allow for better planning and forecasting by public health agencies.
Another business problem could involve improving public health communication strategies—using data on disease trends to optimize when and where to focus public health messaging.
